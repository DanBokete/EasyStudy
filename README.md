## 🔍 About This Version

**Easy Study** is a web application designed to support students with study planning, project tracking, and progress visualization.

This version was my initial proof-of-concept, focused on building the core functionality quickly and testing key ideas. It allowed me to explore:

- Backend development with NestJS
- The proccess of deploying the web application
- Handling study session data and module tracking
- Frontend/backend integration
- React + Tailwind UI design

## ❌ Why It's Archived

After learning from this version’s limitations — including scalability, architecture, and DevOps — I decided to rebuild the project from the ground up in a clean, modern, and production-ready way.
